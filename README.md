# Azure_Public_IP_NSG_Check

Script requires Azure Powershell modules to be installed

This allows you to pull all the public IPs currently in use by the Azure Tenants you have access to and then pulls their NSG Config so you can audit firewall access.
This script was originally written by a coworker of mine, so the credit is due to David.
